Due to the use of pygame- current limitations in available drivers, we are unable to support the hosting of the project at this time.

### Project Description
[Magical Instruments is an innovative project that combines cutting-edge computer vision, machine learning, and audio synthesis to transform simple hand gestures into enchanting musical experiences.
Leveraging the power of MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking, the system decodes hand positions, gestures, and movements into musical notes, tones, and effects. Each gesture is mapped to a specific sound, enabling users to create melodies, rhythms, or soundscapes simply by moving their hands.]

### The Problem statement
[Traditional musical instruments, while beautiful and expressive, are often constrained by physical form, accessibility, and skill barriers. They require space, practice, and often significant financial investment, which limits creative expression for many individuals.What if creating music could transcend these limitations‚Äîbecoming as fluid and accessible as the wave of a hand?]

### The Solution
[We're unleashing the magic of music with just the wave of a hand. By combining cutting-edge computer vision and audio wizardry, we're turning your gestures into symphonies. No more expensive instruments, no more hours of practice‚Äîjust pure, spontaneous musical fun.]
